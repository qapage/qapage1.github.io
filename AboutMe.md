## What is this site about?
QA stands for Quality Assurance. Its all about delivering software that works every time, all the time! We look at different aspects of a product’s quality including but not limited to,

* does it work as expected?
* does it behave well when it encounters unexpected situations/input?
* does it work well under heavier than expected load?

We test quality at different points in the product’s lifecycle. The different types of testing in different phases are,

* Unit testing: done at the lowest level of the code. The basic units that are combined to create software products are individually tested to see if they work as expected.
* Integration testing: done when we want to see how well the different units work together. 
* End to End testing or Acceptance testing: higher level tests that use the system as a blackbox and check if it functions as expected.

There are more types of testing but this should give a beginner *a good introduction to  QA*. This is a page that is for all things QA related.  I’ve relied on a lot of resources on the internet for bringing myself up to speed on topics like performance testing, automation testing, testing process, test metrics etc etc and I always hoped I could find all or most of that information in one place. This site is going to serve as that single source of information for me and hopefully for everyone out there that is looking for QA related information.
