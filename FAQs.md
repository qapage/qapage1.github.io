##### What is QA?
QA stands for Quality Assurance. Its all about delivering software that works every time, all the time! We look at different aspects of a productâ€™s quality including but not limited to,

 * does it work as expected?
 * does it behave well when it encounters unexpected situations/input?
 * does it work well under heavier than expected load?

##### What are the different types of QA?

There are a lot of different types of testing, each of them done at a different time in the project's lifecyle, with a different goal in mind.

 * Unit testing: done at the lowest level of the code. The basic units that are combined to create software products are individually tested to see if they work as expected.
 * Integration testing: done when we want to see how well the different units work together.
 * End to End testing or Acceptance testing: higher level tests that use the system as a blackbox and check if it functions as expected.
 * Performance or load or stress testing: trying to find out how the system performs under heavy loads or trying to find out the system's limits.

##### What are the different QA Metrics?

There are several QA Metrics that are of interest, depending on what kind of project you are working on.

 * Coverage metrics: How much of your code has test cases testing them?  The higher the coverage number, the better.
 * Traceability: Can you look at a defect, go to the code it came from and also go to the requirement it came from? If yes, you can say you have traceability on your project. Traceability helps tie code and defects back to requirements and allows you to ensure you have covered all requirements with tests.
 * Bad defects: What percent of your defects are rejected or invalid or not re-producible? Every team should measure this and try to keep the number as low as possible.
 * Defect injection rate: How many defects do you have per iteration or phase of the product development lifecycle?
 * Defect density: How many defects do you have per 1000 lines of code on your project? That is your defect density.

##### What is accessibility testing?

It is a subset of usability testing, and it is performed to ensure that the application being tested is usable by people with disabilities like hearing, color blindness, old age and other disadvantaged groups
