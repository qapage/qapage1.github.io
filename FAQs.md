##### What is QA?
QA stands for Quality Assurance. Its all about delivering software that works every time, all the time! We look at different aspects of a productâ€™s quality including but not limited to,

 * does it work as expected?
 * does it behave well when it encounters unexpected situations/input?
 * does it work well under heavier than expected load?

##### What are the different types of QA?

There are a lot of different types of testing, each of them done at a different time in the project's lifecyle, with a different goal in mind.

 * Unit testing: done at the lowest level of the code. The basic units that are combined to create software products are individually tested to see if they work as expected.
 * Integration testing: done when we want to see how well the different units work together.
 * End to End testing or Acceptance testing: higher level tests that use the system as a blackbox and check if it functions as expected.
 * Performance or load or stress testing: trying to find out how the system performs under heavy loads or trying to find out the system's limits.
